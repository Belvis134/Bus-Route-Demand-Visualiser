    <ul>
      <li>Initial release of Bus Route Demand Visualiser!</li>
      <li>The "See Selected Stops" and "Show Bus Stop Names" does nothing yet right now. All I have done is bring wickedbrat7's code over, and do some fixes to suit a R app.</li>
      <li>Up next, I plan to add the above features plus include possible data saving, so you don't have to keep uploading every time.</li>
    </ul>
